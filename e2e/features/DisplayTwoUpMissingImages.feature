Feature: Display Two Up Missing Images
  In order to have a more authentic book reading experience
  As a Viewer user
  I want to be able to view two pages at the same time.

#TODO CURRENTLY THIS MANIFEST DOES NOT WORK

#  Scenario: Viewing two pages in a canvas
#    Given the user is viewing the Viewer on its very first page
#    When they click the Next arrow button
#    Then an "Image Unavailable" pop up is displayed to the user
